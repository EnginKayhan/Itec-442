# IoT & CYBER SECURITY
## Eportfolio by Engin Kayhan

## LECTURE 1 & 2

**SCANNING ACTIVITY**


### For the **lectures 1 & 2** we did scanning activities by using Command Prompt. The codes we used were;

**ping =** where we use this to see whether a networked device is reachable

![](/screenshots/ping.png)

ipconfig & ipconfig /all = shows all the current TCP/IP network configuration

![](/screenshots/ipconfig.png)

netstat = to retrive all active connections

![](/screenshots/tracert.png)

tracert = trace the path that an IP packet takes to its destination

## LECTURE 2 & 3

###**DIGITALISATION**

### **What is a 'fully digital enterprise'?**

A fully digital enterprise is where a business has adopted digital technologies to help improve and smooth-run their business

### **What are the cyber Security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise?**

Phishing scams, cloud attacks, IoT attacks, etc.. Basically cyber-attacks

### **What are the cyber security challenges for a bricks and mortar SME wanting to become a digital enterprise?**

They have a negative impact on company and it will lead to loss in revenue where as recovery may not happen

***WITH CYBER KILL CHAIN***

**Cyber Kill Chain steps are;**

+ **Reconnaissance;** is the first stage in the Cyber Kill Chain and involves researching potential targets before carrying out any penetration testing. The reconnaissance stage may include identifying potential targets, finding their vulnerabilities, discovering which third parties are connected to them (and what data they can access), and exploring existing entry points as well as finding new ones.

+ **Weaponization;** stage of the Cyber Kill Chain occurs after reconnaissance has taken place and the attacker has discovered all necessary information about potential targets, such as vulnerabilities. In the weaponization stage, all of the attacker’s preparatory work culminates in the creation of malware to be used against an identified target. Weaponization can include creating new types of malware or modifying existing tools to use in a cyberattack. 

+ **Delivery;** in the delivery stage, cyberweapons and other Cyber Kill Chain tools are used to infiltrate a target’s network and reach users. Delivery may involve sending phishing emails containing malware attachments with subject lines that prompt users to click through. Delivery can also take the form of hacking into an organization’s network and exploiting a hardware or software vulnerability to infiltrate it.

+ **Exploitation;** is the stage that follows delivery and weaponization. In the exploitation step of the Cyber Kill Chain, attackers take advantage of the vulnerabilities they have discovered in previous stages to further infiltrate a target’s network and achieve their objectives. In this process, cybercriminals often move laterally across a network to reach their targets. 

+ **Installation;** after cybercriminals have exploited their target’s vulnerabilities to gain access to a network, they begin the installation stage of the Cyber Kill Chain: attempting to install malware and other cyberweapons onto the target network to take control of its systems and exfiltrate valuable data. In this step, cybercriminals may install cyberweapons and malware using Trojan horses, backdoors, or command-line interfaces.

+ **Command & Controll (C2);** in the C2 stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, cybercriminals communicate with the malware they’ve installed onto a target’s network to instruct cyberweapons or tools to carry out their objectives. For example, attackers may use communication channels to direct computers infected with the Mirai botnet malware to overload a website with traffic or C2 servers to instruct computers to carry out cybercrime objectives.

+ **Action on Objectives;** after cybercriminals have developed cyberweapons, installed them onto a target’s network, and taken control of their target’s network, they begin the final stage of the Cyber Kill Chain: carrying out their cyberattack objectives. While cybercriminals’ objectives vary depending on the type of cyberattack, some examples include weaponizing a botnet to interrupt services with a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, distributing malware to steal sensitive data from a target organization, and using ransomware as a cyber extortion tool.
